# Verification record

Local implementation checkpoint verified October 21, 2026. This records checks actually executed, not production acceptance. Browser, staging and field gates remain open.

## Environment and provenance

- Repository baseline: `9bb3a07321f6fc8a298835e0ec31fc193e106111`, fetched October 20, 2026 (Pacific).
- Branch: `codex/scouting-2026-evidence`. No main or integration changes requested.
- GitHub repository permission reports push access. No open PR or scouting work was found in fetched branches/ledger.
- `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`: 499 packages installed successfully.
- Supabase read-only catalog query: existing profiles, events, event_roles, member_permissions and connector_audit present; no public scouting objects. This is not a live RLS test. No live data changes made.
- Vercel project list found frc-app; detailed project request returned HTTP 403 for team scope. No Vercel CLI installed. Deployment settings and preview/live deployment unverified.
- Original video metadata retrieved, original frames/audio unavailable so far. See evidence matrix.
- Real iPhone/Android, human completion time and annotated real match ground truth cannot be established by browser emulation or fixtures. They remain required field acceptance checks.

## Independent expectations

See `EVIDENCE.md`, `CONTRACT.md`, math fixtures and acceptance mapping. No historical test totals from the handoff are reused as results.

## Completed local checks

| Check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| Final combined `npm test` | 58 files; 918/918 tests passed |
| `npm run build` | Passed; PWA generated with 457 precache entries |
| Connector generation and check | Passed; 173 called functions, 171 reachable, 23 tools, zero direct table writes |
| Design-system audit | Passed; 36 aliases across 3 grounds, 79 components, 315 files |
| Discord calendar regression | 19/19 passed |
| Historical content preservation | 50 original entries byte/SHA identical |
| Independent mathematical oracles | 13 assertions passed |
| React DOM workflows | 17 tests passed, included in combined suite |
| Compiled portable review | All five tabs, mentor planner and parent denial render; zero script errors under DOM/IndexedDB emulation |
| PostgreSQL 18.6 WASM (PGlite) | Full migration chain through 0022 applied twice; 62 new SQL checks, 15 permissive mutants and 563 checks across 23 rollback RLS suites passed |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

React DOM checks use jsdom and fake-indexeddb, including a native-dialog stub. They verify behavior under emulation, not browser layout or phone usability. PGlite is a single-connection WASM PostgreSQL runtime; it does not establish native PostgreSQL16, PostgREST or concurrent-connection correctness. See database-status.md and browser-status.md for reproducible commands and boundaries.

## Blocked and unfinished gates

- GitHub branch creation: HTTP403, Resource not accessible by integration. Shell push lacked credentials. No remote branch or PR created.
- Vercel detailed project access: HTTP403. No preview or production deployment.
- Chromium installed, but launch failed with socket EPERM. Automatic approval review rejected sandbox escalation. No rendered browser or real-device acceptance claimed.
- Native PostgreSQL16 harness unavailable; no live Supabase mutation or staging acceptance.
- Original video frames/audio, real annotated match corpus, provider behavior, real-device interruption recovery and measured beginner usability remain unverified.
- Additional product fidelity gaps and next actions are listed in RESUME.md. No real Discord notifications were sent.

The portable checkpoint contains the implementation, Git history, source evidence, test instructions and private original handoff (outside the public source tree). It is a continuation artifact, not a production-ready release.


## Continued build (October 21)

The final combined run includes reviewed shift planning with atomic local batch saves, eligible roster reads, immutable same-event/team pit replies, side-by-side evidence, pit-location provenance, persisted interactive practice, pick-list drafts, completed-assignment corrections and account-change sync recovery. The actual React screens are packaged in a network-disabled portable review, with separate release instructions and a prepared PR description.

The requested interface visual is a static rendering of the actual React DOM using a print renderer with compatibility CSS. It is not a Chromium screenshot and must not be cited as a layout acceptance test.
